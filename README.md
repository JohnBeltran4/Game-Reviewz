# Game-Reviewz 
Hello, and welcome to GameReviewz! This is a passion project collaborated on by three friends (Ty, Paul, and John), in an effort to develop better Front-End developer skills. We started this project in January of 2023 and continue developing today! 

## What is GameReviewz?
As more of our world becomes digital, it gets increasingly difficult to confirm the legitimacy of a product before you get it. Reliability, price, and much more are common factors in determining whether a product is a proper fit. GameReviewz is a website where you can look up Gaming and Tech related products and find reviews from real people before making a purchase. We want to bridge the gap between purchasing a product and knowing if it's right for you. Here are some of our website's current features with many more to come! 
- User Authentication
- Leave a Review
- Suggest Products
- Accessibility
- Customization
- Weekly Poll Interaction

## Our Code Stack
We utilized React for our Front-End and Spring Boot(Java) for our Backend. We also worked with these technologies for our dev experience. We participated in bi-weekly sprints and met often to discuss progress.
